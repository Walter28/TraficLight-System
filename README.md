# TraficLight-System

This project is the web application of our artificial intelligence system based on reinforcement learning.

It simply consists of monitoring the state of current traffic by representing in real time the vehicles on each lane, the state of each traffic light (Each lane) and the total number of vehicles in each lane.
It is therefore important because it allows traffic officers not to put themselves in danger by remaining all day on the road exposed to the sun but also at the risk of a potential accident.
It will subsequently be layered with an artificial intelligence model based on reinforcement learning to be able to adapt traffic lights according to the traffic situation,
The system is also linked with a system embedded on arduino which manages the hardware part, that is to say the traffic lights on the 4 lanes of a road intersection.
